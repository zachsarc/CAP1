## How does it work and what is the revenue potential, we could also dive into security issues.
## How does it work and what is the revenue potential as far as revenue goes, we could also dive into security issues.

NOTES
----------------
- Cost per unit $25+-
- Potential for creating each unit to have multiple uses (Drone Charging, Celluar Ext., Cameras, etc.)
- 11887171 patent 3

_______
skohl 2/7/24 rough notes:

  Third patent issued, fourth pending 
  Homeowner uses smart system to remove load 
  Has to be initiated legislatively 
  Electric cars (perhaps using smart powerlines as charging stations)
  Anticipate when emergency response required 
  Motivate utility companies by proving this will reduce/prevent insurance liability action 
    -	Use this power source as another revenue source: use as drone landing/charging; atmospheric analysis; pick up gunshot triangulation; 
  Selling/innovation on powerlines 
__________
Jacobs 2/7/24 rough notes:
  -Functionality:
    -Detects any system change in power grid such as drop in voltage
    change downed power line and a re-routing of power
    -Allows capability to change load dependacny to increase efficiancy
    -Saves revenue in insurance claims, dependancy on man-hours from utility crews
    -Non-traditional sources of revenue?
    -Charging vehicles as well as other electrical equipment?
    -Possibility of charging a premium for businesses implementing the system

- Simulation | Examples of multiple situations
- Simulation or maybe a report to show how the AI power lines can improve businesses and domestic homes
