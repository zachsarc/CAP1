skohl 2/7/24 rough notes:

  Third patent issued, fourth pending 
  Homeowner uses smart system to remove load 
  Has to be initiated legislatively 
  Electric cars (perhaps using smart powerlines as charging stations)
  Anticipate when emergency response required 
  Motivate utility companies by proving this will reduce/prevent insurance liability action 
    -	Use this power source as another revenue source: use as drone landing/charging; atmospheric analysis; pick up gunshot triangulation; 
  Selling/innovation on powerlines
